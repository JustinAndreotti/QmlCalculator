TODO
    - On lines 123, 163
        - Get basic math operations underway
    - start with addition and get that working
    - Handle the return of inf when dividing by zero with undefined
    - Handle the return of nan when taking the remainder of zero with undefined
    - Remove all TODO, DEBUG, and TEMP code tags




Current Bugs
    - Change sign does not apply to the m_mainExpression
    - Math on Negative numbers doesnt seem to happen
    - Zero doesnt go into mainExpression if it was not explicit input by the user
      on the first mainResult input
    - after hitting an operator pressing the decimal button doesnt reset the expression
      the same way as if you had pressed another number




Notes
    - Unifinished code has //TODO above and below
    - Debug statements that are intended to be removed have //DEBUG above and below
